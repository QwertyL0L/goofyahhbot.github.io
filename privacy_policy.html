    <h1>Privacy Policy for Goofy ahh Bot</h1>
    <p>By using Goofy ahh Bot, you agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>
    <p2>
        <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
        This privacy policy outlines how we handle and store data collected through the /snipe, /esnipe, /confess, /enable_snipe, /disable_snipe, /bugreport and /suggest
        commands in our Discord bot. By using these commands (or the bot itself), you agree to the collection and storage of certain data as
        described below.

        <h1>2. Data Collection</h1>

        /snipe: This command stores the content of the most recently deleted messages within a channel. The data is
        stored indefinitely unless manually cleared using the /clearsnipe command.

        /esnipe: This command stores the original and edited versions of messages that have been edited within a
        channel. The data is stored indefinitely unless manually cleared using the /clearsnipe command.

        /confess: This command stores anonymous confessions made by users. The confessions are stored indefinitely (for
        safety reasons) and cannot be deleted by users.

        /enable_snipe, /disable_snipe: These commands enable or disable the sniping notifications for the specified server (will be removed in the future).

        /bugreport: This command stores bug reports submitted by users. The bug reports are stored indefinitely (for safety reasons) and cannot be deleted by users.

        /suggest: This command stores suggestions submitted by users. The suggestions are stored indefinitely (for safety reasons) and cannot be deleted by users.

        <h1>3. Data Storage and Retention</h1>
        All data collected through the aforementioned commands is stored indefinitely on our servers. The data will only
        be removed when the /clearsnipe command is executed, which permanently deletes the stored information for the
        specified command(s).

        <h1>4. Data Usage</h1>
        The stored data is used solely for the purpose of providing the functionality of the /snipe, /esnipe, and
        /confess commands. We do not use this data for any other purpose, nor do we share it with third parties.

        <h1>5. User Control</h1>
        Users have the ability to clear the stored data at any time by using the /clearsnipe command. This command will
        permanently delete the stored data for the specified command(s) and cannot be undone.

        <h1>6. Security</h1>
        We take the security of your data seriously. All data stored is protected with appropriate measures to prevent
        unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is
        100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

        <h1>7. Changes to This Policy</h1>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other
        operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be communicated to users through appropriate
        channels.

        <h1>8. Contact Us</h1>
        If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us through our discord server which is located on the home page.

        By using the /snipe, /esnipe, /confess or any other commands, you acknowledge that you have read and understood
        this privacy policy.
